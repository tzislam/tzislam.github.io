#  Research Group Website — PLAN.md
## For Claude Code CLI Execution

---

## 0. Context and Constraints

- **Live URL:** https://per4ml.github.io
- **Repo:** https://github.com/per4ml/per4ml.github.io (branch: `vite-migration`)
- **Stack:** Vite + React (TypeScript). Do NOT revert to static HTML/Python templates.
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages via existing `gh-pages` GitHub Action. Do not break the deployment pipeline.
- **Data philosophy:** All content lives in JSON/BibTeX files under `contents/`. No content is hardcoded in components. The PI edits these files directly in a code editor — no admin UI, no CMS, no student-facing abstraction layer needed.
- **Update workflow:** PI edits `contents/*.json` or `contents/publications.bib` in VS Code → `git push` → GitHub Actions auto-deploys `dist/`. The BibTeX → JSON conversion runs automatically as a `prebuild` step every time.
- **Who updates:** Only Dr. Islam, directly in her editor. Optimize for clarity and minimal friction for a single technical owner — not for delegation.

  }
]
```
Seed this file with all 10 entries visible on tanzimaislam.com.

### `contents/keywords.json`
This file is the **curator's override layer**. Each entry has a `base_weight` (PI's editorial signal) and an optional `aliases` list (alternate spellings to match against BibTeX text).

```json
[
  { "text": "HPC Performance Modeling", "base_weight": 10, "aliases": ["performance modeling", "performance prediction"] },
  { "text": "Few-Shot Learning",         "base_weight": 9,  "aliases": ["few-shot", "FSL"] },
  { "text": "Transfer Learning",         "base_weight": 9,  "aliases": ["cross-system transfer", "domain adaptation"] },
  { "text": "Data-Efficient ML",         "base_weight": 8,  "aliases": ["data-efficient", "data efficiency"] },
  { "text": "Multimodal Learning",       "base_weight": 7,  "aliases": ["multimodal", "heterogeneous data"] },
  { "text": "Scientific Computing",      "base_weight": 7,  "aliases": ["scientific applications", "HPC applications"] },
  { "text": "AI for Systems",            "base_weight": 8,  "aliases": ["ML for systems", "systems intelligence"] },
  { "text": "Quantum Performance",       "base_weight": 5,  "aliases": ["quantum computing", "QuantumX"] },
  { "text": "Reproducibility",           "base_weight": 6,  "aliases": ["reproducible", "nondeterminism"] },
  { "text": "Power-Performance",         "base_weight": 6,  "aliases": ["power-performance trade-off", "energy efficiency"] },
  { "text": "Women in HPC",              "base_weight": 5,  "aliases": ["women in STEM", "BWCSE"] }
]
```

**How the word cloud weight is computed at build time (in `scripts/bib2json.py`):**
1. Parse all titles and abstract fields from `publications.bib`.
2. For each entry in `keywords.json`, count how many BibTeX records contain the keyword text or any of its `aliases` (case-insensitive).
3. `final_weight = base_weight + log2(1 + match_count)` — the log dampens runaway dominance from prolific topics.
4. Output a merged `src/data/keywords_computed.json` with `{ "text": "...", "value": <final_weight> }` format expected by `react-wordcloud`.

This means the word cloud automatically grows more accurate as you add papers, while the PI retains full editorial control over which terms appear and their floor weight.

## 3. Page Layout — Single Scroll, Anchor-Linked Sections

The page is one long scroll. The sticky `NavBar` links jump to these `id` anchors:

```
#hero → #about → #research → #news → #team → #publications → #projects → #funding → #contact
```

### Section order and design specs:

#### `#hero`
- Full-viewport-height hero with lab name **Per4ML**, tagline, and two CTAs: "Our Research ↓" and "Join the Lab".
- Animated particle background (use `tsparticles` or CSS-only — keep it subtle, not distracting).
- Background: dark (navy or deep charcoal). Text: white + accent gold/teal.

#### `#about` — "Who We Are"
- Two-column layout: PI photo (left) + bio text (right).
- Bio sourced from `pi.json`. Stat counters: publications count, funding total, years active, team size — animate on scroll into view.
- Link to PI's personal website.

#### `#research` — "What We Do"
- Full-width keyword **word cloud** (use `react-wordcloud` or `d3-cloud`) driven by `src/data/keywords_computed.json` — the merged output of curated base weights + BibTeX publication frequency (computed by `bib2json.py` at build time, see Section 6).
- Font size encodes `final_weight`. Color cycles through the accent palette. Clicking a keyword filters the publications list below (deep link to `#publications?keyword=...`).
- Below the word cloud: a grid of project cards (from `projects.json`, `featured: true` first).
- Each card: image, title, 2-sentence abstract, tags as chips, optional "Learn More" link.

#### `#news` — "Recent Updates"
- Timeline-style feed (left border line + dot + date).
- Show 5 most recent by default. "Show more" expands in-place (no new page).
- Entries from `news.json`. Category emoji is preserved.

#### `#team` — "Meet the Team"
- Horizontal scrollable strip of cards, grouped by level (PI first, then PhD, MS, Undergrad, Alumni).
- Each card: circular photo, name, level badge, optional link.
- On mobile: vertical stack.

#### `#publications` — "Publications"
- Searchable (title, author, venue, year) + filterable (venue type, year range) list.
- BibTeX parsed at build time via `scripts/bib2json.py` and embedded as JSON.
- Each entry: title (linked to DOI/PDF if available), authors, venue, year, optional badge (Best Paper, etc.).
- Default sort: reverse chronological.

#### `#projects` — "Research Projects"
- One card per row, full-width within the section container.
- Layout per card: fixed-width image panel on the left (40% width, `object-fit: cover`,
  aspect ratio 4:3) + text panel on the right (60% width).
- Text panel contains: project title (h3, accent color), tag chips (small pill badges),
  and the full abstract text.
- Cards are sourced from `projects.json`. Show `active: true` projects only.
  `featured: true` projects appear first; remaining active projects follow in JSON order.
- Every card is wrapped in a `<div role="button" tabIndex={0}>` (not an `<a>` tag,
  since there is no destination URL yet). On click or Enter keypress: no-op for now,
  but log `console.log('Project clicked:', project.id)` as a placeholder.
  Add a subtle `cursor: pointer` and a hover state (slight border highlight or shadow lift)
  so users understand these will become interactive.
- A comment `{/* TODO: replace no-op with router navigation to /projects/:id */}` must
  appear directly in the component so the future sub-page pattern is obvious.
- On mobile (< 768px): image stacks above text, full width.
- No pagination — all active projects are shown. If the list grows beyond ~8 entries,
  a "Show older projects" toggle can be added later.

#### `#funding` — "Our Funders"
- Logo strip of funding agencies: NSF, DOE, AMD, LLNL, BNL, ORNL, NERSC/LBNL, TXST.
- Below: full grant list sourced from `pi.json` (or a separate `funding.json` if preferred).

#### `#contact` — "Join Us / Contact"
- Short call to action for prospective students.
- Email link, lab address, links to apply.

## 5. AI Discoverability (Critical)

This is a first-class requirement, not an afterthought. The goal is for AI systems (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity) to cite Per4ML when users ask about HPC performance modeling, data-efficient ML, few-shot learning for systems, or women in STEM in computing.

### 5.3 Structured Data (JSON-LD in `index.html`)
Inject a `<script type="application/ld+json">` block:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "ResearchProject",
  "name": "Per4ML Laboratory",
  "description": "AI and machine learning methods for high-performance computing system intelligence. Led by Dr. Tanzima Z. Islam at Texas State University.",
  "url": "https://per4ml.github.io",
  "founder": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Tanzima Z. Islam",
    "affiliation": "Texas State University",
    "sameAs": [

    ]
  },
  "keywords": "HPC, machine learning, performance modeling, few-shot learning, transfer learning, data-efficient AI, scientific computing"
}
```

### 5.4 Open Graph + Twitter Card meta tags
In `index.html`:
```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Per4ML Lab — AI for HPC at Texas State University" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Pioneering data-efficient ML for HPC: few-shot learning, transfer learning, and multimodal performance modeling." />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://per4ml.github.io/images/lab/og-image.png" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://per4ml.github.io" />
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
```

### 5.5 Semantic HTML
- Use `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>` correctly.
- Every section heading uses the correct `h1`/`h2`/`h3` hierarchy (only one `h1`).
- Publication entries use `<article>` with `itemscope` / `itemtype="https://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle"`.

---

## 6. Build Pipeline

**Design principle:** `publications.bib` is the single source of truth. The PI edits only that file. Two derived JSON files are auto-generated at build time and committed to `.gitignore` — the site reads from them, never from the raw `.bib`.

### 6.1 Script: `scripts/bib2json.py`

This script does **three jobs** in one pass:

**Job 1 — Publications JSON** (`src/data/publications.json`):
Parse every BibTeX entry and output:
```json
[
  {
    "key": "islam2025modelx",
    "title": "ModelX: Few-Shot HPC Performance Prediction via Cross-System Transfer",
    "authors": ["Tanzima Z. Islam", "Elvis Fefey"],
    "venue": "SC'25",
    "year": 2025,
    "doi": "10.xxxx/xxxxx",
    "pdf": "",
    "url": "",
    "award": "Best Paper",
    "keywords": ["few-shot learning", "transfer learning", "HPC"]
  }
]
```
Use the `bibtexparser` Python library (`pip install bibtexparser`). Map BibTeX fields: `title`, `author` (split on ` and `), `booktitle` or `journal` → `venue`, `year`, `doi`, `url`, `note` → `award` (if note contains "best paper", case-insensitive).

**Job 2 — Keyword weights JSON** (`src/data/keywords_computed.json`):
After parsing publications, compute word cloud weights:
1. Load `contents/keywords.json` (curator's base weights + aliases).
2. For each keyword entry, count BibTeX records where `title + abstract + keywords` fields contain the keyword text or any alias (case-insensitive substring match).
3. `final_weight = base_weight + log2(1 + match_count)` (use `math.log2`).
4. Output:
```json
[
  { "text": "HPC Performance Modeling", "value": 12.3 },
  { "text": "Few-Shot Learning",        "value": 11.1 }
]
```
Sort descending by `value`.

**Job 3 — Stats for About section** (`src/data/stats.json`):
```json
{
  "publication_count": 42,
  "computed_at": "2025-05-15"
}
```
The `About.tsx` component reads this to display the animated publication counter — so the count stays accurate automatically as you add papers.

### 6.2 `package.json` scripts
```json
{
  "prebuild": "python3 scripts/bib2json.py",
  "build": "vite build",
  "dev": "python3 scripts/bib2json.py && vite",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}
```

### 6.3 `.gitignore` additions
```
src/data/publications.json
src/data/keywords_computed.json
src/data/stats.json
```
These are derived artifacts. The source of truth (`publications.bib`, `keywords.json`) is what gets committed.

### 6.4 Sitemap generation
Add `vite-plugin-sitemap` (or equivalent) to `vite.config.ts` to auto-generate `sitemap.xml` at build time with all 8 section anchors as URLs.

---

## 7. Implementation Phases (Execute in Order)

Claude Code must execute these phases sequentially. Do not skip ahead. Verify each phase compiles and renders before moving to the next.

### Phase 1 — Foundation (do this first)
1. Check out branch `vite-migration`. Verify `npm install && npm run dev` works. Note any existing components or data files that can be reused.
2. Add dependencies: `framer-motion`, `react-wordcloud`, `tailwindcss` (if not present), `bibtexparser` (Python, via `pip install bibtexparser`).
3. Create all data files in `contents/` with seed data (see Section 2 and Section 10). Seed `news.json` with all 10 entries. Seed `members.json` with all 12 team members. Create `contents/keywords.json` with the 11-entry curated list from Section 2.
4. Write `scripts/bib2json.py` implementing all three jobs from Section 6.1 exactly. Create a minimal `contents/publications.bib` with 2–3 placeholder entries so the script can be tested immediately.
5. Run `python3 scripts/bib2json.py` and verify it produces all three output files without error.
6. Update `package.json` with `prebuild` and `dev` scripts from Section 6.2. Add `.gitignore` entries from Section 6.3.

### Phase 2 — Layout shell
1. Redesign `src/App.tsx` as a single-page scroll with all section anchors.
2. Build `NavBar.tsx`: sticky, transparent-on-hero then solid on scroll, with smooth-scroll links to all 8 anchors.
3. Apply CSS variables from Section 4 to `index.css`.
4. Add JSON-LD, Open Graph, and Twitter Card to `index.html`.
5. Create `public/robots.txt` and `public/llms.txt`.

### Phase 3 — Sections (build each, then compose)
Build each section component in this order:
1. `Hero.tsx`
2. `About.tsx` (reads `pi.json` + animated stat counters)
3. `Research.tsx` (word cloud from `src/data/keywords_computed.json` — the build-time merged output — plus project cards from `projects.json`; clicking a word deep-links to `#publications?keyword=<text>`)
4. `News.tsx` (timeline from `news.json`, paginated)
5. `Team.tsx` (horizontal strip from `members.json`, grouped by level)
6. `Publications.tsx` (reads compiled `publications.json`, search + filter)
7. `Projects.tsx` (rectangular cards from `projects.json`, image left / abstract right, click no-op with TODO comment for future routing)
8. `Funding.tsx`
9. `Contact.tsx`


### Phase 4 — Polish
1. Add `framer-motion` scroll-triggered animations to every section.
2. Verify mobile responsiveness (320px, 768px, 1440px breakpoints).
3. Run Lighthouse audit. Achieve Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 95, SEO ≥ 95.
4. Verify `npm run build` produces a clean `/dist`.
5. Verify the GitHub Actions deploy workflow is not broken.

---

## 8. Explicit Constraints Claude Code Must Respect

1. **Never hardcode content** in React components. Every piece of text, name, title, and date must come from a JSON file.
2. **Do not remove** `.github/workflows/` or `metadata.json` without checking if they are referenced elsewhere.
3. **Do not use** `localStorage` or any browser storage — this is a static site.
4. **Do not add** a backend or serverless function. Everything must be static and deployable via `gh-pages`.
5. **Image paths** in JSON files are relative to the repo root. In components, resolve them with Vite's `import.meta.url` or by placing images in `public/` and referencing as `/images/...`.
6. **TypeScript strictly** — no `any` types unless absolutely unavoidable with a `// eslint-disable` comment explaining why.
7. **Word cloud** must degrade gracefully if `keywords.json` is empty (show a placeholder message, not a blank div).
9. **BibTeX is the only publications source the PI edits.** `src/data/publications.json`, `keywords_computed.json`, and `stats.json` are derived files — they must never be edited manually and must be in `.gitignore`. If a human edits them directly, the next build will overwrite their changes silently, which is the intended behavior.
10. **The word cloud must never be hardcoded.** It must always read from `src/data/keywords_computed.json`. If that file does not exist (e.g., before first build), the component renders a loading placeholder, not a blank or errored div.
11. **Projects cards must be team-framing, not PI-framing.** Copy must say "the lab studies..."
    or "the team develops..." — never "I" or "Dr. Islam". The PI's name may appear in
    tags or citation context only.
12. **Project routing is forward-compatible.** Every card's wrapping element must have
    `data-project-id={project.id}` so that when sub-pages are added later, a find-and-replace
    on the click handler is sufficient — no structural refactoring needed.
